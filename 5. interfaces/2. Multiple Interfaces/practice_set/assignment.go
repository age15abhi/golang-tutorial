/*

üìù Assignment: Multiple Interfaces
Task:

1. Define two interfaces:

	- Flyer with method Fly()
	- Swimmer with method Swim()

2. Create a struct Duck that implements both Flyer and Swimmer.

	- Fly() should print "Duck is flying"
	- Swim() should print "Duck is swimming"

3. Create a function DoFly(f Flyer) and DoSwim(s Swimmer) that accept those interfaces.

4. In main(), create a Duck and call both DoFly and DoSwim.
