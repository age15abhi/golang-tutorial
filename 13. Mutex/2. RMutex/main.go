/*

You already know about sync.Mutex (a normal lock: only one goroutine can access the resource at a time).

Now, sync.RWMutex is like a more advanced lock that allows multiple readers but only one writer.

üìù Analogy (Easy Way)

Imagine you have a library:

üìñ Readers (RLock): Many people can sit and read the same book at once. No problem, because reading does not change the book.

‚úçÔ∏è Writer (Lock): But if one person wants to write or update the book, no one else can read or write until that person finishes.

So:

RLock() ‚Üí multiple goroutines can read safely.

Lock() ‚Üí only one goroutine can write, and it blocks all readers and writers.
