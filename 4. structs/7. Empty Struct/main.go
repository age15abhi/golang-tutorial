ðŸŸ¢ What is an Empty Struct?

An empty struct in Go is a struct with no fields:

		|	struct{} |

It takes zero bytes of memory.

Often used as a signal or placeholder rather than storing data.

âœ… Key point: Even though itâ€™s a struct, it doesnâ€™t occupy memory, so itâ€™s extremely lightweight.

package main

import (

func main() {
	var x struct{}
	fmt.Println(x)                // {}
	fmt.Println(unsafe.Sizeof(x)) // 0
}
